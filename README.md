# Note-Taking-App
This is a personal project of mine and it is a note taking app. As the name suggests you can take your own notes like a virtual todo list. This application is built with Angular, .Net Core and SQLite.

## How to use
1. Copy this code to your own local computer.
2. The .NET Core webAPI called 'NoteApiService' can be run with Visual Studio
3. The Angular project called 'note-taking-app' can be run with 'npm start' in Visual Studio Code. (nodeJS & angular needed)
4. Run both projects simultaneously and enjoy the magic!!!
